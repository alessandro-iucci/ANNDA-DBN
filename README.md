# ANNDA-DBN

The main purpose for this project is for you to get familiar with some of the key ingredients of deep neural network (DNN) architectures. 
The focus is on restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and deep belief nets (DBNs).
After this project, we learnt how to:
- explain key ideas underlying the learning process of RBMs,
- apply basic algorithms for unsupervised greedy pretraining of RBM layers
and supervised fine-tuning of the resultant DBN,
- design multi-layer neural network architectures based on RBM layers for
classification problems,
- study the functionality of DBNs including generative aspects
